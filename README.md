# Taiwan-AQI-analysis
A multivariate PCA analysis of the effect of pollutants on air quality across Taiwan. Created by Nam Huynh, Martina Nesbeth and Liz Ragsdale.

The python file generates all analysis and visualizations present in the poster and final report. The original dataset, Taiwan Air Quality Index Data 2016-2024, is too large to upload directly here to the repository. However it is originally sourced from Kaggle, which offers several API options for importing data without prior download. In the code file, the mlcroissant library is used for this purpose. 

The needed python libraries installed to run the code are: mlcroissant, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, numpy, and mlp_tookkits

As long as the libraries are installed, the code should run without issue.
