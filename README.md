# Taiwan-AQI-analysis
A multivariate PCA analysis of the effect of pollutants on air quality across Taiwan. Created by Nam Huynh, Martina Nesbeth and Liz Ragsdale.

There are two python files that generate all analysis and visualizations present in the poster and final report. One generates the PCA and multivariate regression findings and the other generates the cluster analysis. The original dataset, Taiwan Air Quality Index Data 2016-2024, is too large to upload directly here to the repository. However it can be downloaded via this google drive link:

To run the python files, copy the filepath of where the downloaded air quality dataset resides and insert it into the blank for path at the begining of each code file. 

The needed python libraries installed to run the code are:pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, numpy, and mlp_tookkits
As long as the libraries are installed, dataset downloaded and path updated, the code should run without issue.
